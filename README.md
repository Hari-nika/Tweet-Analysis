## Tasks
1. Create a visual that shows the average engagement rate and total impressions for tweets posted between '01- 01-2020' and '30-06-2020'. Filter out tweets that received fewer than 100 impressions and like should be 0 and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

2. Plot a scatter chart to analyse the relationship between media engagements and media views for tweets that received more than 10 replies. Highlight tweets with an engagement rate above 5% and this graph should work only between 6PM IST to 11 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be above 50.

3. Create a dual-axis chart that shows the number of media views and media engagements by the day of the week for the last quarter.This graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 30 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'H'.
